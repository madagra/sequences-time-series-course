# Sequences, Time Series and Prediction course material with PyTorch

Implementation of all the code for the [Sequences, Time Series and Prediction](https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction) course written in PyTorch. 

For using the package, you can use the popular `hatch` environment manager:

```shell
python -m pip install hatch

# get into a shell with all dependencies installed
python -m hatch shell

# execute a Jupyter notebook with a summary of all the lessons
# using the PyTorch implementation
# NB: make sure to select the `time_series` kernel for executing the notebook
python -m hatch run ts-notebook
```
